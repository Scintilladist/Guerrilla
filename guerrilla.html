        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>Based on predictive analysis, installing Guerrilla devices in 250 roadside drains in London can reduce the turbidity of the Thames river by 37%. That's a significant impact on water quality, and we're committed to expanding our reach to make even more of a difference. Our partners have seen impressive results with our devices, and we're confident that we can help protect waterways around the world.</p>
